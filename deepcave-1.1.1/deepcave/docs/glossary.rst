    BO
        Bayesian Optimization. A Black-Box optimization algorithm weighing exploration & exploitation
        to find the minimum of its objective.

    SMAC
        SMAC is a tool for algorithm configuration to optimize the parameters of arbitrary algorithms, including hyperparameter optimization of Machine Learning algorithms. The main core consists of Bayesian Optimization in combination with an aggressive racing mechanism to efficiently decide which of two configurations performs better.

    Objective
        An objective is a metric that is to be minimized or maximized. For example, accuracy or loss
        are objectives, whereas accuracy should be maximized and loss be minimized.

    Budget
        A budget is a limit on anything of the algorithm. Most frequently, epochs in Neural Networks
        are restricted or subsets are used.
